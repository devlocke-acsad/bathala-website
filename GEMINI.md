## 3. The Game: An Overview

**(This section should be clean, with text broken into easy-to-read paragraphs, perhaps accompanied by a high-level gameplay GIF.)**

### What is Bathala?

*Bathala* is a single-player, deck-building roguelike set in a world steeped in Filipino mythology. The core of the game revolves around a unique **poker-based combat system**. You are the Babaylan, a spiritual leader tasked with a divine quest: to journey through corrupted lands and restore cosmic harmony.

Each run challenges you to survive a procedurally generated world, where every encounter and every choice matters. You will:

- **BUILD YOUR HAND:** Draw from a 52-card deck and form powerful poker hands to attack, defend, and unleash special abilities.
- **SCULPT YOUR DECK:** At campfires and shops, you can **Purify** (remove), **Attune** (upgrade), and **Infuse** (add) cards, strategically shaping your deck to suit your playstyle.
- **SURVIVE THE CYCLE:** Journey through a world that shifts between day and night. Actions advance the clock, with the day offering safer passage and the night bringing more aggressive and dangerous foes. Survive five full cycles to confront the chapter's final boss.

*Bathala* is a game of strategy, adaptation, and cultural discovery, designed to be endlessly replayable.

### A Mission of Cultural Revival

Beyond its complex mechanics, *Bathala* was created to address the underrepresentation of Filipino mythology in the global gaming landscape. While many games draw from Western and Japanese folklore, the rich pantheon of deities, spirits, and creatures from the Philippines remains largely untapped.

Our mission is to revitalize these indigenous narratives through interactive media, transforming passive learning into participatory cultural appreciation. By embedding Filipino lore, values, and aesthetics into its core, *Bathala* serves as an "interactive mythology museum"—an engaging way for a new generation to connect with their heritage.

## 4. The World of Bathala

**(This section should feature the beautiful background art of the different chapters, like the Ancestral Forest.)**

### A Realm of Myth and Corruption

In the beginning, the divine union of Bathala and Amihan created the islands—a paradise where elemental spirits, the *anito*, lived in perfect balance. But this harmony was shattered. The *engkanto*, spirits of lies and illusion, have twisted the world, corrupting the noble guardians of nature and plunging the realm into chaos.

A prophecy foretells of a hero who can master the sacred elemental deck and mend the fractured world. That hero is you.

Your journey will take you across three distinct chapters:

- **Chapter 1: The Corrupted Ancestral Forests:** Navigate once-sacred balete groves where trickster spirits like the Tikbalang now lead travelers astray and the mighty Kapre, once a guardian, burns the forest it used to protect.
- **Chapter 2: The Submerged Barangays:** Explore drowned coastal settlements inspired by Visayan epics. Here, the healing waters of Tubig clash with the destructive force of Apoy, and the great Bakunawa threatens to devour the moon itself.
- **Chapter 3: The Skyward Citadel:** Ascend to the celestial realm, a dreamlike court of gods and omens. Here, you must confront a false deity born of mythic betrayal and restore order to the heavens.

## 5. Key Features

**(Use icons or small images for each feature to break up the text visually.)**

#### **Strategic Poker-Based Combat**
Combat in *Bathala* is intuitive yet deep. You don't just play cards; you form poker hands. A **Pair** might be a simple jab, but a **Full House** or a **Straight Flush** can unleash devastating power. Strategy is key as you decide whether to play a safe hand now or hold out for a game-changing combination.

#### **The Four Elemental Suits**
The standard card suits are replaced with four elemental forces from Filipino folklore:
- **Apoy (Fire):** Focuses on aggressive, sustained damage-over-time.
- **Tubig (Water):** Emphasizes healing, defense, and cleansing debuffs.
- **Lupa (Earth):** Provides stability, powerful single-turn defense, and counter-attacks.
- **Hangin (Air):** Grants speed, card draw, and evasion for flexible, fast-paced tactics.

#### **A Challenge That Adapts to You (DDA)**
*Bathala* features a Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment system that learns from how you play. By analyzing your performance after each combat, the game subtly adjusts enemy strength and resource availability. This ensures the challenge is always fair and engaging, whether you are a seasoned card shark or a newcomer to the genre. The goal is to keep you in a state of "flow," preventing runs from becoming too frustrating or too easy.

#### **Endless Worlds with Procedural Generation (PCG)**
No two journeys are the same. *Bathala* uses a sophisticated procedural generation system to create a unique overworld map for every run. Inspired by algorithms like Delaunay triangulation, the system generates varied layouts of combat encounters, shops, mysterious events, and campfires, ensuring infinite replayability and strategic variety.

#### **The Landás System: A Narrative Choice**
After each battle, you have a choice: **Slay** your foe for material gain (more gold) or **Spare** them to show mercy (more spirit fragments). This choice is tracked by the Landás system. Your alignment—**Conquest, Balance, or Mercy**—is **completely independent of difficulty**. It purely shapes your narrative journey, influencing story outcomes, unlocking different lore, and determining your ultimate ending.

#### **Powerful Relics & Potions**
Discover and equip up to six **Agimat (Relics)**—powerful passive items that fundamentally change your run. The *Babaylan's Talisman* automatically elevates your poker hand by one tier, while the *Tikbalang's Hoof* gives you a chance to dodge enemy attacks. Use single-use potions for a timely heal, a defensive boost, or to inflict elemental damage.

## 6. Core Research Contributions

**(This section is for your panelists. It should be professional, clear, and technically precise, detailing the main pillars of the thesis project.)**

The development of *Bathala* is grounded in three core research pillars that collectively address challenges in game design, player engagement, and cultural heritage.

### **1. Cultural Preservation through Interactive Media**

A primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the viability of digital games as "interactive mythology museums." The project addresses the significant underrepresentation of Filipino folklore in mainstream gaming by developing a system to authentically integrate cultural narratives into game mechanics.

- **Research Goal:** To design and develop a game that serves as a medium for cultural preservation and education, revitalizing indigenous narratives for a modern audience.
- **Implementation:** This was achieved through extensive research into Filipino folklore (citing sources like the Aswang Project and the works of Maximo Ramos), consultation with cultural experts, and the careful translation of mythological themes, characters (e.g., Tikbalang, Mangangaway), and values (the Landás system) into the game's design, art, and narrative.

### **2. A Rule-Based Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) System**

The central technical contribution is a transparent, rule-based DDA system designed to maintain player "flow."

- **Research Question:** "How can a rule-based adaptive difficulty system be designed to maintain a state of 'flow' for players of varying skill levels in a strategic roguelike game?"
- **Methodology:** We chose a rule-based approach over machine learning for its **transparency and reproducibility**—essential for academic validation. The system is driven by a **Player Performance Score (PPS)**, a 0.0-5.0 scale calculated from eight distinct, weighted performance factors (including Health Retention, Combat Efficiency, Hand Quality, and Clutch Performance).
- **Implementation:** The PPS score maps to one of five difficulty tiers (Struggling, Learning, Thriving, Mastering) that dynamically adjust over 15 parameters, including enemy stats, shop prices, and gold rewards, ensuring a fair but engaging challenge.

### **3. A Delaunay-Inspired Procedural Content Generation (PCG) Framework**

To ensure high replayability and varied gameplay, this research involved the design of a novel PCG system for overworld map generation.

- **Research Goal:** To implement and evaluate a graph-based corridor generation system that creates coherent, navigable, and aesthetically interesting levels while maintaining player engagement.
- **Methodology:** The system uses a seven-stage pipeline inspired by Delaunay triangulation and A* pathfinding:
    1.  **Region Point Sampling:** Distributes anchor points with enforced minimum distance.
    2.  **Triangulation:** Connects points to form a connectivity graph.
    3.  **Edge Sorting:** Prioritizes shorter, local corridors.
    4.  **Multi-Waypoint A* Pathfinding:** Carves paths between points with a custom cost system that penalizes turns.
    5.  **Post-Processing (Pruning & Reduction):** Refines corridors to be single-tile wide and reduces dead-ends to improve navigability.
- **Validation:** The system's effectiveness is measured against clear metrics, including a high connectivity ratio (>95%), low dead-end ratio (<20%), and fast generation time (<25ms), ensuring a high-quality player experience on every run.
